# About Me

You probably know me from somewhere. My name is Freddy Drennan and I have been in and out of data related projects for the past five years. I initially fell in love with the `R` programming language and best practices in programming development - unit testing, well documented code, quality over quantity type stuff. 

I have wanted to break out of my programming rut for a while. Having devoured R, I want a bigger challenge. I'll be blogging about C, C++, and Rust in the coming weeks - taking notes about what I have learned as well and track my own growth.

Thanks for checking this out!
